# Hack Arizona 2020

# The Goal
I collaborated in a team of four to create a prototype that would improve the job seeking and recruiting world.
We were inspired by how college culture embraces dating sites to create connections and meeting people on the spot, and we wanted to incorporate this convenience into the professional world, while keeping face to face connections the top priority.

# What We Did
Our solution implemented AI to take in user's input for a profile, their interests and career goals, and to match them with an employer or seeker based on compatibility.

# How We Did It
We coded in Java and created a UserCollection class with sample data that contained user profile information. We stored key words into ArrayLists and HashMaps and compared data against job recruiters and seekers to create an accuracy score with nearby matches. Java FX is incorporated to display our AI feature [Annette](https://github.com/chelseybergmann/Hack-Arizona-2020/blob/master/Annette.png) whom takes and stores the user's inputs and finds a match. Our primary focus was issuing connections in real time.

# What You'll Need
Java FX must be installed for this version.  However, in the next version we would like to make it an iOS feauture.  Additionally, the sample data file is included in the repository.  This file is used to make matches.

# Challenges We Ran Into
Originally, we desired to create an app and looked into coding with Swift. We soon realized the learning curve was too steep for the 36 hour limit.  We decided to code in something we were all skilled in - Java.
